     	<h3>Our Beginnings</h3>
       		<p class="about">Founded in 2013, BluePaper Media was just a blimp of an idea between three students who wanted to make a difference with their web development and design skills. As graduation came closer for these three students, they decided to make their dream a reality, and after graduation they sent out to do just that. While working odd jobs to support they happy habit, they tried to make a name for themselves everywhere they went. Finally after a few years, Schurter Inc. a computer company hired them on to redesign their company website and their online store. This was BluePaper Media’s ticket to the top, with their skills and mind set they were not only able to satisfy this high-ended customer but they became noticed and now sought out. </p>
            
		<h3>Conquring Middle Ground</h3>
			<p class="about">From humble beginnings at BluePaper Media, they hit the ground running in 2015 with big ambitious to become greater. They finally were able to settle in an office building in downtown Pittsburgh. They have been working out of this office for six months now and it’s easier to welcome clients and build a better network. They are happy to lay their roots and to start growing.
